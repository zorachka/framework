Attention! Project is under heavy development.

Zorachka is not another PHP framework. I'm not reinventing the wheel and just use stable PHP components. 
It's more like a common interface for these components. It's a bridge from infrastructure complexity and you. 

## Installation

If you want to use it separately (why not) you can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require zorachka/framework
```

But it's better to use application skeleton (coming soon).

## Usage

```php
```

## Testing

```bash
make test
```
